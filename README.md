# AldiProject
This was a group project in my Aurora Univeristy Software Engineering Class for Aldi. I was given permission from my group members to uplaod the final program to my github, as the repo we used while working on the project was not mine. My group members were Raquel Gonzalas, Lizabeth Flores, and Brandon Molitor.

The project was as follows:

    PTO Tracker

    The Aldi IT department needs an employee time tracker application. The app must help manage employee paid time off (PTO), that incudes vacation days (VD), sick days (SD), and personal days (PD). Your team needs to work out the precise requirements, design, and eventual implementation. 

    The application needs to have the following general capabilities:
    1.	The application needs to track the number of vacation days (VD), sick days (SD), and personal days (PD) each employee has per year. For example, each year, an employee with 2 years of experience may have 10 VD, 6 SD, and 5 PD. 
    2.	Employees will log into the system to request one or more days off. Each employee has different annual PTOs depending upon their level and company experience.
    3.	The application should also track the number of VD, SD, and PD remaining for each employee. For example, if an employee who annually receives 10 VD, takes a 4-day vacation, then the system would indicate that they have 6 more VDs remaining.   
    4.	Employees must use the PTO tracker application to request VD, SD, and PD. Each category (VD, SD, and PD) have a lead time. For example, there may be a requirement that VD must be requested ten days before the date. The lead time may be different for each category. 
    5.	Once an employee requests time off, the request should notify the proper supervisor. The supervisor can approve, request more information, or reject employee requests. 
    6.	The employee must be able to produce a report of their year-to-date total available and consumed VD, PD, and SD. 
    7.	A supervisor must be able to produce a report of an employeeâ€™s year-to-date available and consumed VD, PD, and SD. This report is only available for the employees that report to the supervisor. 
    8.	The application should load employee total annual and consumed VD, PD, and SD from the Aldi HR system (possibly via an API interface). The interface to load this data should be flexible to alternative data input formats. 
    9.	The system must be able to produce an audit report that compares the data in the HR system with the application
    10.	The system should act properly if an employee or supervisor leaves during the year. 
    11.	The system should also track the Aldi standard holidays. (e.g., 12/25, 7/4, 1/1, etc.). The application must load all holidays via an API interface (and not be hard-coded).
    12.	The system must be secure.
    13.	The system must respond quickly and store data in a database. 
    14.	The system should be easy to use. 

PLEASE NOTE: This program is not finished to the standards of the company, as we were told to get as much done in the time alotted. There are some features that are not fully functional. Much more could be finished and added to the program.
